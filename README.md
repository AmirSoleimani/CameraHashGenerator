## what is TRNGs?

> True Random Number Generators (TRNGs). This method generates a true random number, and uses some form of random process. One approach is to monitor the movements of a mouse pointer on a screen or from the camera frame. Overall the method is generally slow, especially if it involves human interaction, but is non-deterministic and aperiodic.
